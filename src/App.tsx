/*

I am building an intenary planning web app that displays the events in a calendar view.
I chose CSS Grid because I want to avoid calculating each events in absolute positioning,
like what Google Calendar and other calendar web apps is doing.

Using CSS Grid, if I define all the possible dates and times as the line names
and CSS classes, I can easily place the events on specified date and time,
just by specifying the CSS class on an element. Because of this,
there are thousands of line names and thousands of CSS classes. While this may look like an abuse of browser feature, it seems like all modern browsers can handle it just fine.

One of the challenges faced is on how to display overlapping events.
If there are events that overlap with each other,
I want the day column to split into multiple columns to accomodate
for each of the overlapping events.
However, how to determine how many columns needed?
Also, how to make non-overlapping events to "span" across all the columns for the day?
Solving this turned out to be like solving a Leetcode problem.
